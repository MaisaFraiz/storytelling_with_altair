    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to replicate the examples from Cole Nussbaumer's book, \"Storytelling with Data - Let's Practice!\", using `Python Altair`. Our primary objective is to document the reasoning behind the modifications proposed by the author, while also highlighting the challenges that arise when transitioning from the book's Excel-based approach to programming in a different software environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Altair` was selected for this project due to its declarative syntax, interactivity, grammar of graphics, and compatibility with `Streamlit` and other web formatting tools, while within the user-friendly Python environment. Anticipated challenges include the comparatively smaller documentation and development community of Altair compared to more established libraries like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, or `Plotly`. Furthermore, tasks that might appear straightforward in Excel may require multiple iterations to translate effectively into the language.\n"
